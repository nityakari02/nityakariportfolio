## ðŸ“Š Projects

### 1. Music Popularity Prediction
- **Description:** Developed a comprehensive analysis to predict the popularity of songs using machine learning techniques. By leveraging features such as loudness and danceability, the project aims to classify songs as popular or not accurately. Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression models to evaluate the predictive power of these features and conducted extensive data visualization and model evaluation to ensure robust results.
- **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
- **Repository:** [Music Popularity Prediction](https://github.com/nityakari02/musicpopularityprediction.git)

### 2. Clustering Fashion Retail Sales Data
- **Description:** Performed a clustering analysis on fashion retail sales data to uncover patterns in customer satisfaction based on purchase amounts. The primary goal was to identify whether customers' satisfaction ratings cluster into meaningful groups based on the amount they spend. This analysis provides insights into customer behavior and the relationship between purchase amounts and satisfaction levels, aiding in targeted marketing strategies and customer service improvements.
- **Technologies:** R, RStudio, tidyverse, cluster, NbClust, aricode, factoextra, ggplot2
- **Repository:** [Clustering Fashion Retail Sales Data](https://github.com/nityakari02/fashionclusteringanalysis.git)

### 3. Predictive Analysis of Diabetes in Pima Indian Females Using Diagnostic Measurements
- **Description:** Conducted an in-depth predictive analysis on a dataset of Pima Indian females to determine the relationship between various health metrics and diabetes status. Applied logistic regression and other statistical techniques to analyze diagnostic measurements, uncovering valuable insights into the predictors of diabetes that can inform healthcare practices and early intervention strategies.
- **Technologies:** R, tidyverse, caret, rms, factoextra, ggplot2
- **Repository:** [Predictive Analysis of Diabetes](https://github.com/nityakari02/predictiveanalysisdiabetes.git)

### 4. An Analysis of Physicochemical Factors in Red Portuguese 'Vinho Verde' Wine Quality
- **Description:** Conducted an in-depth analysis of the physicochemical properties of red wine to predict its quality. Applied various statistical methods to analyze the relationship between wine properties and quality, uncovering valuable insights that can inform wine production and quality control processes.
- **Technologies:** R, tidyverse, corrplot, psych, caret, glmnet, rms, factoextra, ggplot2, GGally
