## ðŸ“Š Projects

### 1. Music Popularity Prediction
- **Description:** Developed a comprehensive analysis to predict the popularity of songs using machine learning techniques. By leveraging features such as loudness and danceability, the project aims to classify songs as popular or not accurately. Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression models to evaluate the predictive power of these features and conducted extensive data visualization and model evaluation to ensure robust results.
- **Technologies:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
- **Repository:** [Music Popularity Prediction](https://github.com/nityakari02/musicpopularityprediction.git)

### 2. Retail Sales Forecasting
- **Description:** Implemented advanced time series analysis techniques to forecast future sales for a major retail company. Leveraged ARIMA and Facebook Prophet models to predict sales trends, aiding in inventory management and sales strategy planning to enhance operational efficiency and profitability.
- **Technologies:** R, ggplot2, forecast, Prophet
- **Repository:** [Retail Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/yourusername/retail-sales-forecasting)

### 3. Twitter Sentiment Analysis
- **Description:** Conducted an in-depth sentiment analysis on Twitter data to gauge public opinion on trending topics. Applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweet sentiments, uncovering valuable insights into public mood and perception that can inform marketing and communication strategies.
